        Strength in numbers
        Instead of being led by a single Nike Master Trainer, the Breakthrough Challenge features a team of five, each with a specific expertise. It’s the most varied program in the app—and every workout builds on the previous one. One day might be dedicated to building core strength, the next to yoga for increased mobility. Then that strength and flexibility you’ve been working on may feed into high-intensity training.“If you’ve never done something—whether it’s yoga or crab walks—you may wonder why you should give it a shot,” says Nike Master Trainer Alex Silver-Fagan. “We’ll show you how these relate to one another—and help you see you’re capable of things you might not have realized.”
